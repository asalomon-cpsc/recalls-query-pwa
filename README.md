# CPSC Recalls APP

> The goal of the recalls PWA app is to act as a mechanism that gives consumers convenient access (from their mobile devices) to recalls. Consumers will be able to quickly lookup a particular product based on a set of criteria when they are shopping online or at a store to check if the product was recalled by the manufacturer(s).
